I was born in Santiago de Chile, in a time where playing on the streets with marbels, [kites](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volant%C3%ADn) and ["trompos"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trompo)  was fashionable among kids. I grew up in a low-SES family, raised primarily by my paternal grandmother (a childcare cook) since my biological mother left home when I was around 2 years old to never return. Luckily, I was born at the right time for a child from a poor family: the [military dictatorship of Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_of_Chile_(1973%E2%80%931990)) was coming to an end, Chile was experimenting [fast economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_Chile), [poverty was shrinking](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?end=2017&locations=CL&start=1987&view=chart), and a brand new safety net was being putting into place by the [new democratic government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_transition_to_democracy). Children like me benefit from such developments, which in my case meant access to better public schools and healthcare: I became the first member of my family to finish high school, then go to college and to pursue graduate education.

Fast forward to my adolescence, I (involuntarily!) started a career in dancing when I was around 15 years old. After high-school, I entered to study a [B.A. on Contemporary Dance at the Arts Department at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.artes.uchile.cl/danza). After devoting six years of my life to dancing, I decided to change directions to pursue my intellectual curiosity. Dancing gave me a lot: appreciation for beauty and creativity, a drive for continuous improvement, respect for discipline, and more importantly, the opportunity to meet my wife, with whom I have been together for more than a decade. Yet, dancing can be ruthless as well: injuries, pain, fearless competition (i.e., few chances for stable jobs), and few opportunities for deep thinking and creation (unless you are a choreographer, and I was not!).

At 21, I obtained a full scholarship to study a [B.A. in Sociology at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.facso.uchile.cl/sociologia). Sociology is a discipline with blurry limits which was perfect for my difficulty deciding between my interest on history, philosophy, economics and psychology. Attending to college was a life changing experience on many dimensions. It opened my eyes to the [massive socio-economic inequalities in my country](https://wid.world/country/chile/). In a highly unequal and segregated society, if you grew up poor, you most likely will just get to know poor people like you, with similar life experiences and upbringings. Learning about the life experiences of classmates from middle class and upper class families was a truly "ethnographical experience": yes, we are all human beings, we even shared language and nationality, yet, it felt to me like getting to know people from a different country. An equally important revelation was [SCIENCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cd36WJ79z4)! I just felt in love with science and academia. I learned what was a "PhD" and to be a "Professor" and by my second year of college I decided that I wanted to be scientist.

After finishing my sociology degree, I was granted a [second full scholarship](https://www.conicyt.cl/becasconicyt/) to study a [master's degree in Public Policy at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.econ.uchile.cl/es/programa/magister-en-politicas-publicas#introduccion-2). Doing my masters was a terrific experience socially and intellectually. I made wonderful friends from a wide variety of backgrounds, from countries like Colombia, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Since my program was based at the Economics Department, I learned quite a lot of economics and econometrics, which has been tremendously useful to make sense of the political and economic order on which I live. Concomitant to my master's studies, I worked for two years at the [Center for Neuroeconomics from the Universidad Diego Portales](http://www.neuroeconomia.udp.cl/equipo.html). During my time there I learned about experimental psychology, behavioral economics, cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. I also published [my first research paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00204/full) and I learned how to do EEG research (i.e., to record and analyze patterns of electrical brain activity).

In 2017 I relocated to the US with my wife and my dog to pursue a [PhD in Psychology at UW-Madison](https://psych.wisc.edu/people/graduate-students/), with the support of a [Fulbright Scholarship](http://www.fulbright.cl/). Moving to the US has been both incredible challenging and amazingly rewarding. Learning English on the fly, adjusting to a new culture, re-building your social network, and navigating US institutions while you do a PhD is not an easy feat. Fortunately, my wife and I have a meet a group of wonderful people that have helped us to adjust. Having lived my entire life in Santiago, a [big messy concrete jungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago), living in [Madison](https://realestate.usnews.com/places/wisconsin/madison) has been a blessing: clean air, green spaces, parks everywhere, safety, short commuting times, bike lines, and friendly bus drivers and neighbors. True, Wisconsin winters can be brutal, but I realized that I enjoy the cold fresh air on my face, and that I can say things like "Winter is Coming" with property.

It is hard to describe how awesome is to be part of an academic institution like UW-Madison. Being here is basically my "Disneyland", a dream come true. Nonetheless, after three semester in my program, I realized that even though I do really enjoy science, pursuing a traditional academic career as a professor in a research intensive university is not the best fit for me. Yet, I still enjoy and trust in the value science! I deeply admire and appreciate the work of many researchers and professor, that generates new and exiting knowledge and technologies. This is why redirecting my energy to a career as research scientist/data scientist in an industrial setting rather than academia. The (higher) prevalence of teamwork, more tangible goals, and the proximity of industrial research with real-life problems are highly appealing to me. This does not mean that I do not enjoy pursuing long-term goals and complex projects, but teamwork.    

Nowadays, I enjoy taking long walks with my wife and dog, biking around Madison, playing the ancient [game of "Go"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) (a.k.a "Baduk" in South Korea or "Weiqui" in China), reading fantasy novels, and reading books about mathematics, artificial intelligence, programming, computer science, and social issues. I am also a huge fan of Broadway Musicals and I love to perform dramatic male solos ("Santa fe" and "The Music of the Night" are two of my favorites) for my wife, dog and neighbors.
