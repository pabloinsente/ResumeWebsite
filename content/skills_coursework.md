- Programming and automation techniques using **BASH** and **Python**
- Computational Modelling with **Python**
- Version control using **Git** and **GitHub**
- Design and analysis of psychological experiments with adults and children
- Design and analysis of survey research
- Advance writing, speaking and communication skills on Spanish (native) and English (fluent)
- Team leadership and organization in survey research and psychological experiments

# Coursework

This is a selection of courses that I have taken during my graduate education (i.e., MPP and PhD) in three areas: psychology and neuroscience, statistics and programming, and economics and public policy. This are all full-semester courses. I also added a list of on-line courses that I have been taking as complementary study.
