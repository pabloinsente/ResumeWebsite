This a selection of projects that I have done during my graduate education (i.e., MPP and PhD) on which I have made use of several of my technical skills and domain knowledge. They come in three formats: research projects, thesis projects, and class projects.

## Project 7
### measuring and Assessing the Structure of Human Conceptual Representations using machine learning methods
- **Type:** Research paper (in design phase)
- **Method:** Combination of (1)(1) Psychological questionnaires; (2) Machine learning methods; (3) and Statistical analysis
- **Role:** Lead researcher
- **Software:** R and Python

## Project 6
### Exploring the Impact of Early Life Stress on Learning in Dynamic Environments
- **Type:** Research paper (in progress)
- **Method:** Combination of (1) Psychological questionnaires; (2) Learning and decision-making task; (3) computational modelling (reinforcement learning delta-rule model); (4) and statistical analysis (multiple linear regression analysis and correlational analysis)   
- **Role:** Lead researcher
- **Software:** R and MATLAB

## Project 5
### [Pipeline automation to reproduce and evaluate the variability of genealogical patterns across the genome] (https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools-2018/project-team-9)
- **Type:** Class project
- **Method:** Python and BASH programming
- **Role:** One of three authors
- **Software:** Python and BASH

## Project 4
### [Psychological experiment about learning social preferences under stress] (https://github.com/pabloinsente/psych-711-project)
- **Type:** Class project
- **Method:** Python programming using the Psychopy library
- **Role:** Lead and only author
- **Software:** Python

## Project 3
### Neurocognitve Basis of Impulsive Buying Behavior
- **Type:** Research paper (in progress)
- **Method:** Combination of (1) Intercept survey to buyers on supermarkets; (2) Decision-making behavioral experiment; (3) and electrophysiological (EEG) recording and analysis.
- **Role:** Lead researcher. I designed and performed all the stages of the project: field work protocols, survey application, decision-making experiment, and EEG recordings and data cleaning
- **Software:** MATLAB, EEG-Lab library and Presentation (Neurobehavioral systems)

## Project 2
### [Low Cognitive Impulsivity Is Associated with Better Gain and Loss Learning in a Probabilistic Decision-Making Task] (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00204/full)
- **Type:** Research paper
- **Method:** Combination of (1) Psychological questionnaires; (2) Learning and decision-making task; (3) and statistical analysis (logistic regression, ANOVA and correlational analysis)
- **Role:** Lead researcher. I collected the data, collaborated on the statistical analysis, and co-authored a research paper as lead-author
- **Software:** MATLAB and Presentation (Neurobehavioral systems)

## Project 1
### [Fitness, Nutrition and Academic Performance in Socioeconomic Context (in Spanish)] (http://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/145490)
- **Type:** Master's thesis in public policy
- **Method:** Statistical analysis of large database with educational records of Chilean students (multiple linear regression with and without fixed effects)
- **Role:** Lead researcher
- **Software:** STATA
