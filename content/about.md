I'm a third-year PhD student in Psychology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://psych.wisc.edu/people/graduate-students/).

My research interests lies at the intersection of cognitive science, machine learning, and data science. My professional goal is to pursue a career as a Research Scientist/Data Scientist, by using of my training in the social sciences, cognitive sciences, statistics, machine learning, and programming.

I have a broad interdisciplinary training. I did my B.A in Sociology in the [Sociology Department at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.facso.uchile.cl/sociologia), where I focused my studies on social class inequalities, child development, and data analysis. Next, I completed a Masters degree in Public Policy from the [Economics Department at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.fen.uchile.cl/es), focusing my research on educational policy, child-wellbeing, and applied econometrics. Concomitant to my master's studies, I worked for two years in the [Center for Neuroeconomics at the Diego Portales University](http://www.neuroeconomia.udp.cl/equipo.html), doing research on learning and decision-making using behavioral and EEG techniques.       

During my time at UW-Madison, I have done research in learning and decision-making processes of children from high-stress backgrounds in the [Child Emotion Lab](https://childemotion.wiscweb.wisc.edu/graduate-students/), combining traditional experimental psychology, statistical analysis, and computational modelling. My current research explore the relationship between computational models of cognition and knowledge representation in machine learning. I am also interested in applied machine learning, data visualization, reproducibility in scientific computing, and software engineering skills in the cognitive and social sciences. As an extension of my interest in data science, I founded and organize the [Madison Chapter of the PyDatya Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Madison/).

I'm being co-advised by [Joseph Austerweil] (https://alab.psych.wisc.edu/) and [Timothy T. Rogers](http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/) from the UW-Madison Psychology Department. My studies are being supported by a [Fulbright Scholarship](https://fulbright.org/) and the Chilean Government.

Starting on June 2020, I'll be a Data Science Intern at Airbnb, San Francisco, CA.
