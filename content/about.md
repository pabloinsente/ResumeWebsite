I'm a second-year PhD student in Psychology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://psych.wisc.edu/people/graduate-students/).

My research interests lies at the intersection of cognitive science, machine learning, and data science. My professional goal is to pursue a career as a Research Scientist/Data Scientist, making use of my training in the social sciences, cognitive sciences, statistics, machine learning, and programming.

I have a broad interdisciplinary training. I did my B.A in Sociology in the [Sociology Department at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.facso.uchile.cl/sociologia), where I focused my studies on social class inequalities and child development. Next, I obtained a Masters degree in Public Policy from the [Economics Department at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.fen.uchile.cl/es), focusing my research on educational policy and child-wellbeing. Concomitant to my master's studies, I worked for two years in the [Center for Neuroeconomics at the Diego Portales University](http://www.neuroeconomia.udp.cl/equipo.html), doing research on learning and decision-making using behavioral and EEG techniques.       

During my time at UW-Madison, I have been working on learning and decision-making processes on children from high-stress backgrounds in the [Child Emotion Lab](https://childemotion.wiscweb.wisc.edu/graduate-students/). Now, I'm redirecting my efforts to the use of machine learning and cognitive science to address questions related to knowledge representation, skill acquisition, and learning. To pursue this agenda, I'm being co-advised by [Joseph Austerweil] (https://alab.psych.wisc.edu/) and [Timothy T. Rogers](http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/) from the UW-Madison Psychology Department. My studies are being supported by a [Fulbright Scholarship](https://fulbright.org/) and the Chilean Government.
