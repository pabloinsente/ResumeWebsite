Iâ€™m a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Psychology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://psych.wisc.edu/people/graduate-students/), specializing in cognitive science and data science. I'm also the organizer of the PyData Meetup at Madison, WI.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of cognitive science and data science. My professional goal is to pursue a career as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, or UX researcher, utilizing my training in the social sciences, cognitive sciences, statistics, machine learning, and programming. I'm passionate about applying advanced statistics, experimental methods, and a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative techniques to tackle real-world problems. 

I am also passionate about educating and empowering others in the use of and application of data science and machine learning tools. This is why I created and maintain several freely accessible educational projects ranging from Linear Algebra and Calculus for Machine Learning to essential tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Tensorflow. 

I have more than 3 years of expertise working with Python and R on building machine learning systems, statistical analysis, and data visualization, and SQL / PostgreSQL for database management. I believe that creating reliable, reproducible, and clean data-science workflows is fundamental for both production systems and academic research, which is the reason why I emphasize good software development practices in my work. 

I have a broad interdisciplinary training. I did my B.A in Sociology in the [Sociology Department at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.facso.uchile.cl/sociologia), where I focused my studies on social class inequalities, child development, and data analysis. Next, I completed a Master's degree in Public Policy from the [Economics Department at the Universidad de Chile](http://www.fen.uchile.cl/es), focusing my research on educational policy, child-wellbeing, and applied econometrics. Concomitant to my master's studies, I worked for two years in the [Center for Neuroeconomics at the Diego Portales University](http://www.neuroeconomia.udp.cl/equipo.html), doing research on learning and decision-making using behavioral, electrophysiology, and statistical modeling techniques.       

My current advisor is [Timothy T. Rogers](http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/) from the UW-Madison Psychology Department. My studies are being supported by a [Fulbright Scholarship](https://fulbright.org/) and the Chilean Government.

Starting in May 2021, I'll be a Data Science Intern at Airbnb, NYC, NY.
